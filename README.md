# Cryptocurrencies
  Challenge 18
  
## Project Overview
Using unsupervised leaning to process data, cluster, reduce dimensions, and reduce principal components using PCA, I created an analysis of the cryptocurrency market. I created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.

There are a total of 532 tradable cryptocurrencies. They are classified into 4 groups the PCA algorithm reduces the crytocurrencies dimensions to 3 principal components. Each class needs to be analyzed further to see more detailed investment performance.
